<p>Human Robot Interaction project is made with purpose of integrating robots in a everyday life, but to make it useful and productive. The project is made for museum visitors in order to increase interest among them and help to learn something new. 
Combination of Microsoft Kinect and Humanoid Robot Nao can help museum visitors with an orientation within a facility, so people get useful information about exhibit in time.</p>

<p>Microsoft Kinect - device which is able to recognize human and also enables users to control and interact with different device without using any remote controls, but through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands. Humanoid Robot Nao - robot prototype with a variety of hardware devices installed, such as sensors, audio input and output, cameras and etc, which make interaction with robot easier and attractive. </p>

<p>	
The project will be based on the autonomous tour-guide/tutor robot, which will programmed to perform tours in the museums. Comparing with ordinary guides robots are able to readjust to different age groups in order to make the museum program interesting and understandable for every visitor starting from youths to the elderly part of the society. Moreover, the material presented by robots will not only be adjusted for different age groups, but will also be focused on explaining the “real” meaning of the exhibit. To make it more clear, the presentation performed by people is focused on simply giving general knowledge, history and the techniques used by the author, however the work of robots will be focused on delivering and explaining the significance of author’s work. Currently, people do not try to acquire the most significant point of the exhibits, thus the robot will be focused on making the audience engaged in the process.</p>

<a id="definition-of-success" class="anchor" href="#definition-of-success" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definition of success</h3>

<p>In order to complete the project successfully, multiple objectives must be accomplished, and project might be evaluated with the 
following criteria: Is the main goal in creating automatic guide that might replace human beings in the nearby future is created. 
Apart from the main goal, it is crucial to look from the HRI perspective and inspect how successful is HRI element implemented in the project,
how accurate are the results delivered by Kinekt in detecting age groups and most importantly, does the robot reaches its aim in bringing the joy to the audience.</p>
