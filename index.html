<p>
  
  To integrate robotics in everyday life, it is important to consider what factors affect the robot's ability to persuade and deliver information effectively
Combination of Microsoft Kinect and Humanoid Robot Nao can help to find out the effectiveness of age factor.</p>

<p>Microsoft Kinect - device which is able to recognize human and also enables users to control and interact with different device without using any remote controls, but through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands. Humanoid Robot Nao - robot prototype with a variety of hardware devices installed, such as sensors, audio input and output, cameras and etc, which make interaction with robot easier and attractive. </p>

<p>	
This work explores how age and relationship of people affects to a humanoid robot and its ability to influence human behavior and how it is perceived in three dimensions: trust, confidence and cooperation. It is assumed that these three traits that are considered important for a convincing communicator must also be linked to the ability of the robot to achieve compliance to some request. In this case, compliance is measured on the basis of the willingness of subjects to donate something in response to the request made by the robot. This request comes after the educational interaction in which the robot explains some of its technical capabilities. At the request of donation items asked to fill out a questionnaire containing three measures mentioned above attitude. The age and relationship will be detected by Kinect and robot will select appropriate text for different cases (child/teenager/adult or their relationship)

<p>In order to complete the project successfully, multiple objectives must be accomplished, and project might be evaluated with the 
following criteria: Is the main goal in creating the robot that brings information effectively is reached. 
Apart from the main goal, it is crucial to look from the HRI perspective and inspect how successful is HRI element implemented in the project,
how accurate are the results delivered by Kinekt in detecting age groups and most importantly, does the robot reaches its aim in bringing the joy to the audience.</p>
