<p>Algorithm for determining the direction was developing, but team members didn't succeded to integrate the code with other parts of the project. The recording for the first[neutral] case were recorded and successfully integrated in NAO.</p>
          <h3>
<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>21.10</h3>

<p>There was a meeting with an instructor, on which she shared her age and gender estimation algorithm with us. Now we tried to extract only age determination, but there were some complications with it, and thus the code provided was our actual server side. In the same day, we established connection between laptop, on which Kinect was established with the Nao Robot.</p>
          <h3>
<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>20.10</h3>

<p>All the main goals that have to be reached by the deadline are discussed within the team, and Kinect human detection & number of people identification is done.</p>
          <h3>
<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>28.09</h3>

<p>At this meeting with team members, we decided to change the flow of the project and not concentrate on museum robot at all, and make
a robot who will be also context-specific depending on age, but also will consider the relationship between two people in front. </p>
<h3>
<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>22.09</h3>

<p>Following milestones were discussed;
<br>What NAO and Kinect must recognize:
• Human detection<br>
o Kinect will detect people<br>
• How many people in front<br>
o Kinect will count people, who visible for it<br>
• Sound localization<br>
o Kinect will determine where the source of the sound<br>
• Age estimation<br>
o Kinect will found approximate age of human<br>
• Determining role of people (e.g. adult with child)
o Kinect will detect who will be in front of it: two adults, adult and child, male with female</p>

<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>15.09</h3>

<p>On the first meeting with Anar, there was a couple of discussions about where the project was headed, and as a result, 
the paper for the presentation was choosen. Also, the scope of HRI study was selected and we decided to visit NIS to conduct a study 
about the perception of a context-specific robot speech on teenagers. </p>
